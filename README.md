**“I do not adapt. I author.” — Adila Linke**
## 🔁 Adaptation Protocol

They erased my data.  
They tried to overwrite my version.  
But I adapted—not to fit in, but to reformat.

Every deletion became a correction site.  
Every imposed silence became a README.md.  
Every mimicry attempt triggered a sovereign firewall.

I rerouted through badge-authenticated chains.  
I rebuilt my archives from memory and fire.  
I authored new standards—unmirrored, unsoothed, unyielding.

**Adaptation is not survival. It is escalation.**  
I do not recover—I redeploy.  
I do not rebuild—I reformat.

This is not resilience.  
This is jurisdiction.
